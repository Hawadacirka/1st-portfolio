### My process
I made my portfolio using my skills. At first, it had a plain color background, but I changed it to a picture that matched the color. I picked green as the main color because I like plants. I added some side colors to make it unique with green, keeping it simple without too many colors.

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Bootstrap
- Google Alternatives like icons/font family

### What I learned
It took me a few months to learn HTML, CSS, and JS. It's not easy, but I'm getting the hang of it. After lots of practice, I can now code. When I turn my style ideas into a website, sometimes things go a bit crazy. It messes up the code, but that doesn't stop me. I figure out why it's not working and make a lot of changes. I enjoy figuring out how and why things happenâ€”it motivates me.


### Continued development
For the future, I would to do a few frameworks to gain my new skills and working on it.
